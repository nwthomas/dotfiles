# CLAUDE.md

A generic starter file for new repositories. It provides highâ€‘level guidance on common tasks, development workflow, and tooling that can be adapted to most projects.

Prompt Claude Code to overwrite this file with repository-specific instructions.

## Common Commands

| Task | Command | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| List files | `ls` | See repository contents |
| Show git status | `git status` | Check changed files |
| Run tests | _(depends on project)_ | Execute unit and integration tests |
| Lint code | _(depends on project)_ | Verify style and syntax |

## Development Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch**: `git checkout -b feature/<current git username>/*`
2. **Make changes**: edit files, run linters and tests.
3. **Commit**: Use clear, actionable commit messages.
4. **Push**: `git push -u origin feature/<current git username>/*`
5. **Open a PR**: `gh pr create` or via GitHub UI.

## Documentation

- Keep README concise but informative.
- Include a changelog if the project follows semantic versioning.
- Document any required environment variables or credentials in a separate `env.example`.

This section should be updated to reflect a given repository's stack.
