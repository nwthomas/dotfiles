OpenCode provides an alternative to Claude Code and Claude Code Router.

In my own personal testing, it blows Claude Code and Claude Code Router out of the water when you're using locally-hosted models. It's a bit more complex to set up, but it's worth it.

To get started, you need to install the opencode CLI.

```bash
npm install -g opencode
```

Then, you need to create a config file.

```bash
opencode init
```

Finally, you need to create an opencode.json file, preferably globally (although you can use a local-to-project one if you want).

Documentation for OpenCode best practice usage can be found here: hhttps://opencode.ai

OpenCode commands:
- opencode init
