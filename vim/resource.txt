This directory is a work in progress as I learn Vim syntax and Neovim.

The best starting resource for me was just installing Vim/Neovim and running `nvim` and then `:Tutor` for the introductory syntax and keybindings.

However, good follow-up resources that have proven helpful on my journey are:

1. Vimtutor - https://vimschool.netlify.app/introduction/vimtutor
2. Vim School - https://vimschool.netlify.app
3. Vim Adventures - https://vim-adventures.com
4. Vim Mastery - https://vimmastery.com
5. Vim Tips - https://vimtips.org
6. Vim Golf - https://vimgolf.com
